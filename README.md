### About me

<!--
**fidelsteiner/fidelsteiner** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a research scientist studying high mountain hydrology and climate, the cryosphere in high mountain Asia and Greenland as well associated geomorphological processes. I also work on turning science into policy and practice.
